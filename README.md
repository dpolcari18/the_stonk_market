## The Stonk Market

The Stonk Market is a lightweight "stock" trading platform that allows users to search any company listed on the NYSE and either follow that company or purchase "shares" in that company.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project came from the desire to challenge ourselves. My partner and I both find personal finance/investing fascinating and wanted to push ourselves to work with an API for the first time. The end product is a fake trading platform that uses real companies and realtime stock prices.
